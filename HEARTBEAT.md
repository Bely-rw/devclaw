# HEARTBEAT.md — Periodic Tasks

# Keep this file empty (or with only comments) to skip heartbeat actions.
# Add tasks below when you want the agent to check something periodically.
#
# Examples:
#   - Check server health: ssh prod "systemctl status myapp"
#   - Daily summary: review today's memory and send a brief to the user
#   - Monitor disk: bash "df -h | grep -E '(9[0-9]|100)%'"
